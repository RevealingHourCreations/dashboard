## DevOps Dashboard
This file consists of the hardware design files, scripts and documentation about the Dashboard project.

### Continuous integration
DashPi integrates with Jenkins and gives fun indicators of your builds. So the next time you fail some test, it'll make sure that everyone on your floor knows aboit ;-)
### Deployment
DashPi makes you like Han Solo when you are deploying. Nuff said.

### Operations
Once everything is up and running fine, DashPi will help you monitor your app. So that you can go ahead and play those all-important TT tournaments.
